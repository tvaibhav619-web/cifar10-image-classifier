🖼️ CIFAR-10 Image Classifier (PyTorch + Streamlit)

A complete deep-learning project that trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, saves the trained model, and provides a Streamlit web app for making predictions on images.

🚀 Built with PyTorch, Torchvision, Streamlit, and Python 3.10+.

📌 Features

✔ Train a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset

✔ Save the trained model (.pth file)

✔ Upload any image and get prediction

✔ Interactive Streamlit web app

✔ Simple project structure (easy to understand)

✔ GPU support (CUDA compatible)

🧠 Dataset — CIFAR-10

CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 color images (32×32 pixels) across 10 classes:

airplane

automobile

bird

cat

deer

dog

frog

horse

ship

truck

🚀 How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cifar10-image-classifier.git
cd cifar10-image-classifier

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Train the Model

Run the training script to create the model file:

python src/train.py


This will generate:

models/cifar10_model.pth

4️⃣ Run the Streamlit Web App
streamlit run app.py


A web app will open in your browser.

🖥️ Streamlit App Preview

The web app allows you to:

Upload an image

Press Predict

See the predicted class + confidence

📈 Model Architecture

A simple CNN:

2 Convolution layers

ReLU activations

MaxPooling layers

2 Fully connected layers

CrossEntropyLoss

Adam Optimizer

You can replace this with more advanced models (ResNet, MobileNet, etc.).
